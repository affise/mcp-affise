## 🎯 Smart Category Resolution

### **The Problem with Traditional Tools**
```bash
# Traditional API call
GET /offers?category="gamng"
→ Result: 0 offers found (typo breaks everything)

# Another traditional call  
GET /offers?category="games"
→ Result: 0 offers found (exact name required: "Gaming")
```

### **Our Smart Solution**
```bash
# Natural language with typo correction
"Find gamng offers for mobile traffic"

# Smart resolution process:
1. Detects typo: "gamng" 
2. Auto-corrects to: "gaming"
3. Maps to categories: ["Gaming", "Casino", "Mobile Games"]
4. Returns: 47 relevant offers with confidence score
```

### **Real-World Examples**
